# Lack the drive to level up as a developer? You’re in the right place!

When we started working as developers, the world felt like a lonely, cruel place at times. The lack of communication and collaboration was damaging the flow of great ideas, and hindering their growth. 

We quickly took note of the fact that open-source projects, in addition to being more time-efficient and cost-affective are an amazing opportunity to grow for all. No matter what your skill level is, or which languages your well-versed in, there is always space for you to contribute and make the project better — while honing your skills and growing as a developer.

The end result: The world receives an amazing product, one that helps solve actual issues, and you get invaluable experience, as well as a supportive collaborative community.

We are not a web development organization, nor a marketing organization. We are a group of like-minded individuals who are unified by a single idea —  **create something great, learn & improve ourselves along the way.**

All of the projects and ideas we work on are created using the **latest technologies,** and we look into every aspect of the development before committing  to a tech stack. We think that communication and planning is key, and don’t go into projects without thinking every aspect through.

However, should things go awry, there will be a contingency plan set in place, as well as supportive community for you to lean on, and bounce ideas off of.
