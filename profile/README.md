# Lack the drive to level up as a developer? You’re in the right place!

When we started working as developers, the world felt like a lonely, cruel place at times. The lack of communication and collaboration was damaging the flow of great ideas, and hindering their (as well as our own) growth. 

We quickly took note of the fact that open-source projects, in addition to being more time-efficient and cost-affective are an amazing opportunity for everyone invlolved. No matter what your skill level is, or which languages you prefer to work with, there's always space for you to contribute and make the project better — while honing your skills as a developer.

The end result: The world receives an amazing product, one that helps solve actual issues, and you get invaluable experience, as well as a supportive collaborative community.

We are not a web development organization, nor a marketing one. We are a group of like-minded individuals who are unified by a single idea —  **create something great, learn & improve ourselves along the way.**

All of the projects and ideas we work on are created using the **latest technologies,** and we look into every aspect of the development before committing  to a tech stack. We think that communication and planning is key, and don’t go into projects without thinking every aspect through.

However, should things go awry, there will be a contingency plan set in place, as well as supportive community for you to lean on, and bounce ideas off of.
